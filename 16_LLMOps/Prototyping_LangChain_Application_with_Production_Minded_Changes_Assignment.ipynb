        "The approach of caching the results of LLM calls in memory, allowing subsequent identical calls to return the cached result instead of re-querying the LLM. While this can improve performance in certain scenarios, it comes with several limitations and trade-offs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. InMemoryCache stores all cached data in RAM, it is constrained by the available memory on the machine.\n",
        "2. InMemoryCache stores data in memory (RAM), meaning the cache is cleared when the application restarts or crashes.\n",
        "3. This approach maybe an issue for concurrent access in multi-threaded or multi-process environments.\n",
        "4. InMemoryCache doesn’t provide built-in monitoring or metrics (e.g., cache hit/miss rates, memory usage)\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is most useful in prototyping, development, or short-lived scripts, or applications with repetitive queries or limited query diversity (e.g., a FAQ bot with a fixed set of questions).\n",
        "This approach is least useful for long-running production applications such as a production chatbot serving thousands of users, or applications with multiple instances or high query volume (e.g., a web app with load-balanced servers)."
