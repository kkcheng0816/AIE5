        "> NOTE: Determining the core difference between `async` and `sync` will be useful! If you get stuck - ask ChatGPT!\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "1. Improved Performance and Responsiveness\n",
        "Concurrent Requests: The async approach allows multiple embedding requests to be processed concurrently. This is particularly useful when:\n",
        "You have a batch of texts that need embeddings.\n",
        "You are interacting with an API that supports high throughput and can handle multiple requests in parallel.\n",
        "Reduced Idle Time: While waiting for one API response, the program can continue executing other tasks, thereby reducing idle CPU time.\n",
        "2. Better Scalability\n",
        "When working with a high number of requests (e.g., embedding a large dataset), synchronous approaches can become a bottleneck due to blocking operations.\n",
        "With async, the application can efficiently handle many requests without needing additional threads or processes, making it more scalable.\n",
        "3. Resource Efficiency\n",
        "Lower Memory Footprint:\n",
        "Compared to multithreading or multiprocessing, async operations use fewer resources because they do not create multiple threads or processes. Instead, they use a single thread with an event loop.\n",
        "Efficient Networking:\n",
        "Network I/O operations, like making HTTP requests to the OpenAI API, are inherently slow compared to CPU operations. The async approach allows other tasks to proceed during this I/O wait, improving overall efficiency.\n",
        "4. Better User Experience in Interactive Applications\n",
        "For applications with user interfaces or APIs (e.g., web apps, chatbots, or dashboards), async operations keep the application responsive by ensuring that embedding requests do not block other interactions."

            "### 1. **For Loop**:\n",
