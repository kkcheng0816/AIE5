        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

Previous studies have\\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs\\nin reasoning (called \"reasoning actions\"), such as step-by-step thinking,\\nreflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations.\\nHowever, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions\\nuniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of\\neach question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we\\npropose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal\\nreasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each\\nquestion and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach\\ninvolves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can\\nbe composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the\\noptimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative\\nexploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using\\nthe collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning\\ntrajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning\\nparadigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the\\ntask-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an\\ninternalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across\\neight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static\\nreasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further\\nanalysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based\\non problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder\\nproblems.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-01-01\\nTitle: WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct\\nAuthors: Haipeng Luo, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Pu Zhao, Jianguang Lou, Chongyang Tao, Xiubo Geng, Qingwei Lin, Shifeng Chen, Yansong Tang, Dongmei Zhang\\nSummary: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable\\nperformance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging\\nmathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only\\npre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization.\\nIn this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT\\nreasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying\\nour proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method\\nto the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical\\nreasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary\\ncapabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier\\nopen-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency.\\nFurthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini\\nPro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration\\nhighlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in\\nachieving exceptional math performance.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT.

However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to a generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The presence of additional context from the retrieval step helps the model generate more informed and precise outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the model needs to generate responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI. By leveraging both retrieval and generation, RAG can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses than using a generative model alone.\""
