That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

'John Wick' is praised for delivering awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero, all tied together by its simplicity.\n",
            "What is the general reception of the John Wick film series?\n",
            "The John Wick film series is apparently loved by everyone else in the world, with the fourth installment scoring immensely at the cinemas.\n",
            "Who Chad Stahelski and what he do in John Wick?\n",
            "Chad Stahelski is the director of John Wick, and as a stunt specialist, he showcases his expertise through the film's virtuoso action sequences and well-made choreographies.\n",
            "What John Wick movie about, and how it do with story and action?\n",
            "The John Wick movie is about a retired assassin, known as the 'Boogeyman,' who has suffered a personal tragedy. After he and his dog fall victim to a group of Russian mobsters, he seeks vengeance. The film starts slow and ambiguous but becomes action-packed with stylized, visceral action scenes and an impressive arsenal of weaponry. However, it lacks a strong story and the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem become redundant. Keanu Reeves delivers his lines with sardonic wit and fits well in the role.\n",
            "What is the plot of the first John Wick movie?\n",
            "In the original John Wick (2014), an ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that killed his dog and took everything from him. With the untimely death of his beloved wife still bitter in his mouth, he seeks vengeance. When an arrogant Russian mob prince and hoodlums steal his car and kill his dog, they are fully aware of his lethal capacity. The Bogeyman will find himself dragged into an impossible task as every killer in the business dreams of cornering the legendary Wick, who now has an enormous price on his head. Blind with revenge, John unleashes a carefully orchestrated maelstrom of destruction against those who attempt to chase him, with a price tag on his head, as he is the target of hit men: an army of bounty-hunting killers on his trail and a murderer woman everywhere. The legendary hitman is forced to unearth his meticulously concealed identity and carry out a relentless vendetta. Now, only blood can quench the boogeyman's thirst for retribution.\n",
            "What are the criticisms of John Wick Chapter 2 in terms of action and plot development?\n",
            "Critics of John Wick Chapter 2 have pointed out that while the film is relentlessly violent, with Keanu Reeves' character dispatching foes with headshots, it fails to bring anything new to the action genre. The director, Chad Stahelski, is noted for not introducing new elements to the action sequences. Additionally, unlike the first film, which was surprising and convincing in its own fantasy logic, John Wick 2 lacks the element of surprise and does not have the same impact, which works against it.\n",
            "Why John Wick 2 not surprise like first movie and how John Wick Chapter 2 still fun and good with action and set design?\n",
            "John Wick 2 doesn't have the ability to surprise like the first movie because the original film was unexpected in its cartoonish yet brutal action and convincing fantasy world. However, John Wick Chapter 2 remains fun and engaging due to its over-the-top action, impressive set design, and camera work, making it a high bar for escapist entertainment.\n",
            "How does the action and narrative development in John Wick 2 compare to the expectations set by John Wick 3, considering the franchise's evolution and the challenges faced by the latest installment?\n",
            "John Wick 2, while unable to surprise audiences as the first film did, continued to deliver on the franchise's signature brutal and cartoonish action within its unique fantasy world. However, it faced challenges in maintaining the element of surprise. In contrast, the anticipation for the latest installment, following John Wick 3's release in 2019, was met with skepticism due to its delayed release until March 2023. Despite high expectations from the franchise's reputation, the latest film was perceived as a disappointment, indicating challenges in narrative development and meeting audience expectations.\n",
            "In what ways does 'John Wick: Chapter 4' build upon the stylistic and action elements established in 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum', and how does it contribute to the franchise's development and Keanu Reeves' status as a martial arts action star?\n",
            "'John Wick: Chapter 4' builds upon the stylistic and action elements established in 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' by continuing the tradition of starting the action from the very beginning of the film and maintaining it until the end. This installment not only maintains the high level of action and style seen in Chapter 3, which was praised for its insane style and visually stunning sequences, such as Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists, but also improves upon it. 'John Wick: Chapter 4' solidifies Keanu Reeves' status as the greatest martial arts action star of all time, or at the very least, as part of the greatest martial arts action pairing with Director Chad Stahelski in modern times. This progression contributes significantly to the franchise's development by enhancing its reputation for high-quality action and further establishing its lead actor's iconic status in the genre.\n",
            "How does 'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' balance its visual style with its storytelling, and what are the criticisms regarding its originality?\n",
            "'John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum' is praised for its insane visual style, with scenes such as Keanu Reeves on horseback shooting at motorcyclists being highlighted as some of the best looking action sequences. However, the film is criticized for its lack of originality in storytelling, as it is described as feeling like a boring video game with a repetitive plot focused on John Wick running and killing assassins for a bounty on his head. While the initial action sequences are considered original, the film is ultimately seen as tiresome and repetitive.\n"

        "    1. Used Ragas to create a golden dataset with 10 examples of questions and related answers\n",
        "    2. Created 4 LangSmith customized labeled_score_evaluators for relevancy, precision, recall and faithfulness, ran evaluators on 7 retrievers by using the golden dataset\n",
        "    3. After comparing the langsmith evaluation results, I found the cost and latency results seem make sense while the relvancy, precision, recall and faithfulness scores generated by the customized evaluators seems not trustable because Naive Retrieval got the best scores\n",
        "    4. Ran Ragas Evaluator on each retrieval chain to compare 6 RAG metrics   \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Summary on my Evaluation Results\n",
        "1. Cost\n",
        "    - The most expensive retrieval is Ensemble Retrieval, and it runs multiple retrievers and merges results. So its cost was higher than other retrievals. I am not sure why the cost was not doubled or trippled.\n",
        "    - The 2nd expensive retrieval is Multi-Query Retrieval as it generates multiple queries, often using a language model, which increases computational cost. Additional retrieval passes and result aggregation adds to resource usage.\n",
        "2. Latency\n",
        "    - Ensemble Retrieval had the longest latency. As LangChain’s EnsembleRetriever typically executes retrievers in parallel where possible, it minizes the latency. So its latency was higher than other retrievals but not much higher.\n",
        "    - Multi-Query Retrieval had the 2nd longest latency. Multiple queries mean multiple retrieval operations, increasing latency compared to single-query methods.\n",
        "3. Performance\n",
        "    - Ensemble Retrieval got the highest scores on context_recall, faithfulness and factual-correctness, and 2nd high on answer_relevancy (lower than parent document retrieval). Because this retrieval combines strengths of different methods (e.g., lexical precision of BM25 and semantic depth of embeddings), leading to robust recall and precision.\n",
        "    - Parent Document Retrieval got the highest scores on faithfulness and answer_relevancy. Because it enhances context by returning full documents rather than isolated snippets, improving relevance for tasks needing broader understanding.\n",
        "    - Contextual Compression (Rerank) Retrieval excels at improving precision by leveraging semantic understanding, making it ideal for queries requiring nuanced relevance. but it did not excel in the evaluation results compared with other retrievals. \n",
        "    - With only 10 examples and one time run, the evaluation results may not conclude correctly. \n",
